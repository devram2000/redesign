   		What makes a website interface "good" in terms of user experience and visual design?

    <div class="overview">
		  <p>
        
        Intuitively, we can feel when a website interface looks clean and operates well; 
        it is much harder to identify the qualities that "good" interfaces have. 
        This raises the question: <i>is a "good" interface subjective?</i>
		  </p>

      <p>
        The answer to this question should not be as simple as a yes or no answer. 
        Think about it: everyone has different opinions on what innately looks good.
        Additionally, other factors like age, experience, cultural values, etc. can
        alter how a person views and interacts with a particular interface.
        However, there are indeed certain principles that can improve upon
        overall user experience and visual design, and these can be identified as the 
        defining features of a "good" inteface. 
		  </p>

      <p>
        To get some insight on this from a real-world example, I will be evaluating the homepage of 
        a local restaurant called Quitos Seafood Restaurant & Bar 
        (reference the image linked to their website above) for areas of improvement in terms 
        of the usable/accessible aspects of user experience and visual design principles. Ultimately,
        I will provide a responsive website redesign of the Quitos homepage that will attempt 
        to improve upon the interface.

		  <h2>Usability and Accessibility</h2>

      Learnability: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?
      Efficiency: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?
      Memorability: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, 
      how easily can they reestablish proficiency?

      <h3>Usability Evaluation</h3>
      
      <h4>Learnability:</h4>
      <i>Evaluator Description: Will first time users be able to easily traverse and use the interface?</i>
      
      <p> For first time users, the current set up of the website is confusing to use for the following reasons:</p>
      <ul> 
      <li>The only way , instead of the button being in the </li>

      </ul> 
      

      <h4>Memorability:</h4>
      <i>Evaluator Description: Will users who have not used the interface in a while recall how to traverse and use the interface with ease?</i>
      <p>In terms of Memorability, as there are multiple ways (even though )</p>
      
      <h4>Efficiency:</h4>
      <i>Evaluator Description: Will experienced users be able to quickly traverse and use the interface?</i>
      <p>Experienced users will mostly return to the website to primarily utilize two functionalities:
      ordering online or making an online reservation. As of now, these two buttons on the main page are not
      placed/sized for efficiency. For instance, the Loyal Lobster Program flyer is almost quadruple the size
      of the online reservation and online order sections. While the reservation button is relatively 
      easy to find, the order online button is in a row of two other functionality boxes (gift cards and hours)
      and is smaller than both of them, making it much more difficult to efficiently locate and click.</p>

      <h4>Usability:</h4>
      In terms of overall usability, this webpage interface is definitely not ideal specifically in the Learnability and
      Memorability categories.
      There are multiple  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2019/08/what-is-parallax-scrolling-explained-with-examples/">parallex images</a>

      <h3>Accessibility Evaluation</h3>
      <h4>WebAIM WAVE:</h4>  
      I used the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</a> as a check
      for various accessibility measurements for the Quitos webpage. In summary, there are various places
      where images are missing alternative text, forms are missing labels, and links are empty; all of 
      which can pose issues in terms of accessibility for the user. There are multiple instances of pdfs 
      being linked, which is a suboptimal way to convey information on a webpage due to navigation difficulties
      and other accessibility issues. Last, the footer of the website has very low contrast between the text
      and the background which can make it difficult to read the text.
      
      <h4>Screen Reader:</h4>
      To evaluate accessibility for visually impaired users, I used a Screen Reader to read out the webpage 
      in the audio form. In terms of interpretation, it was not too clear to me what the website was, but 
      that may just be because I am not used to consuming webpage content in the audio form. It seemed like the
      text jumped around a lot in terms of content category, so that added to the comprehension issues.
      Also, all of the text that are in the image form were not read out, which means that a substatial portion
      of the webpage would be missed by visually impaired users.

      <h4>Google Translate:</h4>
      To evaluate accessibility for non-english speakers, I used Google Translate to translate the webpage
      from English to various other languages. Simlar to the issue with the screen reader, the flyers, buttons, 
      and other text in the image form were not translated to the new language. This heavily impacted the 
      overall comprehension of the website because functionalities like "Order Online" and "Join Now" for 
      the Loyal Lobster program were not translated.

		  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
        While the original interface for Quitos website was usable, it definitely was not ideal! Remember, no 
        interface will ever be universally perfect, but we can always work towards making the interface a convenience
        instead of an obstacle such that the user can experience the website's functionality as efficiently as possible.
		  </p>

		  <p>
        Hopefully, you can now identify and possibly even utilize some of the qualities that
        make a web interface "good" moving forward!
