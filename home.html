    <h1>Webpage Redesign: Local Restaurant</h1>
    <h2>
   		What makes a website interface "good" in terms of user experience and visual design?

    <div class="overview">
		  <p>
        
        Intuitively, we can feel when a website interface looks clean and operates well; 
        it is much harder to identify the qualities that "good" interfaces have. 
        This raises the question: <i>is a "good" interface subjective?</i>
		  </p>

      <p>
        The answer to this question should not be as simple as a yes or no answer. 
        Think about it: everyone has different opinions on what innately looks good.
        Additionally, other factors like age, experience, cultural values, etc. can
        alter how a person views and interacts with a particular interface.
        However, there are indeed certain principles that can improve upon
        overall user experience and visual design, and these can be identified as the 
        defining features of a "good" inteface. 
		  </p>

      <p>
        To get some insight on this from a real-world example, I will be evaluating the homepage of 
        a local restaurant called Quito's Seafood Restaurant & Bar 
        (reference the image linked to their website above) for areas of improvement in terms 
        of the usable/accessible aspects of user experience and visual design principles. Ultimately,
        I will provide a responsive website redesign of the Quito's homepage that will attempt 
        to improve upon the interface.

		  <h2>Usability and Accessibility</h2>

      <h3>Usability Evaluation</h3>
      
      <h4>Learnability:</h4>
      <h5>Evaluator Description: Will first time users be able to easily traverse and use the interface?</h5>
      
      <p> For first time users, the current set up of the Quito's main page is confusing to use for the following reasons:</p>
      <ul> 
      <li>The structure of the webpage is not consistent.</li>
        <li style="margin-left:2em">There are rows with multiple items that are relatively condensed and rows with only 
        one item surrounded with whitespace for no apparent reason.</li>
      <li>The "New Fall Hours" on the top of the page differ from the hours later in the page. The dates and times 
      are also not aligned in terms of structure intuitively.</li>
        <li style="margin-left:2em">The new hours on the top of the page also only have the open time and not the closing time.</li>
      <li>In the Navigation Bar, the main page of the website (the one currently being evaluated) is not linked. 
      Therefore, the only way to get back to the title screen is by clicking on the top image, which is not signified 
      to be linked in any way.</li>
      <li>The section in the Navigation Bar for the website contains a Menu and Reservations section when these sections 
      already exist on the main page; this would not be an issue if these links were directed to the same place, 
      but they both link to different sections/webpages. </li>
        <li style="margin-left:2em">The menus included on the main page and the 
        menus included in the menu section of the Navigation are different (e.g. the Beer and Wine Menu is not included 
        in the page from the Navigation Bar and the Fall Specials Menu is not included in the main page).</li>

      </ul> 
      

      <h4>Memorability:</h4>
      <h5>Evaluator Description: Will users who have not used the interface in a while recall how to traverse and use the interface with ease?</h5>
      <p>In terms of Memorability, returning users should not have too much trouble relearning functionality
       as the website is not too complex and has relatively clear labels. </p>
      
      <h4>Efficiency:</h4>
      <h5>Evaluator Description: Will experienced users be able to quickly traverse and use the interface?</h5>
      <p>Experienced users will mostly return to the website to primarily utilize two functionalities:
      ordering online or making an online reservation. As of now, these two buttons on the main page are not
      placed/sized for efficiency.</p>

      <p> For instance, the Loyal Lobster Program flyer is almost quadruple the size
      of the online reservation and online order sections without being 4 times as important. While the reservation button is relatively 
      easy to find, the order online button is in a row of two other functionality boxes (gift cards and hours)
      and is smaller than both of them, making it much more difficult to efficiently locate and click.</p>

      <h4>Usability:</h4>
      In terms of overall usability, this webpage interface is definitely not ideal specifically in the Learnability and
      Memorability categories. Here are some other miscellaneous and overarching usability issues:
      <ul> 
      <li>The search icon in the Navigation Bar does not work.</li>
      <li>There are multiple  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2019/08/what-is-parallax-scrolling-explained-with-examples/">
      parallex images</a> which are very cool, but they obscure the readability of the website.</li>
        <li style="margin-left:2em">The first parallax image has text overlayed that inconveniently disappears when you scroll just a little bit.</li>
        <li style="margin-left:2em">The second parallax image has text overlayed that is hard to read because it does not contrast much from the image.</li>
      <li>There is effectively no color hierarchy.</li>
        <li style="margin-left:2em">The background of the menu boxes, items that are supposed to be on the same level,
        are different shades of blue.</li>
      <li>The size hierarchy does not reflect importance of the sections.</li>
      <li>Most of the information in the footer does not need to be there (should be in the About and Contact Us sections of the Navigation Bar).</li>
      </ul> 
      


      <h3>Accessibility Evaluation</h3>
      <h4>WebAIM WAVE:</h4>  
      I used the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</a> as a check
      for various accessibility measurements for the Quito's webpage. In summary, there are various places
      where images are missing alternative text, forms are missing labels, and links are empty; all of 
      which can pose issues in terms of accessibility for the user. There are multiple instances of pdfs 
      being linked, which is a suboptimal way to convey information on a webpage due to navigation difficulties
      and other accessibility issues. Last, the footer of the website has very low contrast between the text
      and the background which can make it difficult to read the text.
      
      <h4>Screen Reader:</h4>
      To evaluate accessibility for visually impaired users, I used a Screen Reader to read out the webpage 
      in the audio form. In terms of interpretation, it was not too clear to me what the website was, but 
      that may just be because I am not used to consuming webpage content in the audio form. It seemed like the
      text jumped around a lot in terms of content category, so that added to the comprehension issues.
      Also, all of the text that are in the image form were not read out, which means that a substatial portion
      of the webpage would be missed by visually impaired users.

      <h4>Google Translate:</h4>
      To evaluate accessibility for non-english speakers, I used Google Translate to translate the webpage
      from English to various other languages. Simlar to the issue with the screen reader, the flyers, buttons, 
      and other text in the image form were not translated to the new language. This heavily impacted the 
      overall comprehension of the website because functionalities like "Order Online" and "Join Now" for 
      the Loyal Lobster program were not translated.

    <div class="part2">
		  <h2>Visual Redesign</h2>
      With the above Usability and Accessibility issues with the current Quito's webpage interface in mind, 
      I started to begin structuring the webpage's redesign.
      <h3>Low-fidelity Wireframing</h3>
      <h4>Desktop Wireframe</h4>
      <div class="lofi lofi-desktop">
        <img src="lofi/Desktop.png" alt="Desktop Wireframe"/>
      </div>
      <h4>Tablet Wireframe</h4>
      <div class="lofi lofi-tablet">
        <img src="lofi/Tablet.png" alt="Tablet Wireframe"/>
      </div>
      <h4>Phone Wireframe</h4>
      <div class="lofi lofi-phone">
        <img src="lofi/Phone.png" alt="Phone Wireframe"/>
      </div>

      <h3>High-Fidelity Prototyping</h3>
      <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FrsmO9Zn7uthGDtEpqHSyb3%2FRedesign%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <h3>Visual Design Style Guide</h3>
      <h4>Color Hierarchy</h4>
      <div class="spacing b1">Primary Color</div>
      <div class="spacing b2">Secondary Color</div>
      <div class="spacing b3">Tertiary Color</div>
      <div class="spacing b4">Quaternary Color</div>
      <div class="spacing b5">Quinary Color</div>

      <h4>Buttons</h4>
        <button class="spacing b1"><div class = "button1">PRIMARY BUTTON</divs></button>
        <button class="spacing b2"><div class = "button1">SECONDARY BUTTON</divs></button>
        <button class="spacing b3"><div class = "button1">TERTIARY BUTTON</divs></button>

      <li>"Helvetica Neue"</li>
      <ul>
    </div>

    <div class="part3">
      <h2>Responsive Redesign</h2>
      Finally, I implemented the newly redesigned webpage for Quito's based on the above wireframe, prototype,
      and style guide. Note that the main focus of this redesign was the interface of the main page; therefore,
      links to other pages/functionalities from the main page are dummy links.
		  <h3>
      <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="responsive/redesign.html">Quito's Redesigned</a>
      </h3>
      In terms of structure and color hierarchy, this redesign is a lot more clear to the user as there are consistent
      and meaningful rankings. Accessibility concerns are improved upon as well.
    </div>
    
    <div class="conclusion">
		  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
        While the original interface for Quito's website was usable, it definitely was not ideal! Remember, no 
        interface will ever be universally perfect, but we can always work towards making the interface a convenience
        instead of an obstacle such that the user can experience the website's functionality as efficiently as possible.
		  </p>

		  <p>
        Hopefully, you can now identify and possibly even utilize some of the qualities that
        make a web interface "good" moving forward!
