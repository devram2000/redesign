      <p>
        While the original interface for Quitos website was usable, it definitely was not ideal! Remember, no 
        interface will ever be universally perfect, but we can always work towards making the interface a convenience
        instead of an obstacle such that the user can experience the website's functionality as efficiently as possible.

        Hopefully, you can now identify and possibly even utilize some of the qualities that
        make a web interface "good" moving forward!
